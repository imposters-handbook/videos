# Code For The Imposter's Handbook Videos

This is the code for the 16 video walkthroughs in the Imposter's Hanbook. If you want to follow along, you'll need to have Node installed (6+) and, optionally, Elixir if you want to do the functional programming stuff (which you should!).

I do all of the samples within the Atom text editor using the Script Runner plugin, which is east to find and install.

Have fun!
